# React Form Validation

Use controlled components to implement a form (with validations) to add new "emails" to an email list.

<!-- 1. Add email state to Form component, project the state to the input value and handle the onChange event to update the state -->

<!-- 2. Add error state to the Form component, validate the input value in the onChange handler and set the error value. -->

<!-- 3. Add touch state to Form component. handle the onBlur event to set it. -->

<!-- 4. display errors/success messages, colors and icons based on the touch and error states. -->

5. handle the onSubmit event to add a new user (check props.addEmail). Don't forget the e.preventDefault().

Happy coding!!!! <3
